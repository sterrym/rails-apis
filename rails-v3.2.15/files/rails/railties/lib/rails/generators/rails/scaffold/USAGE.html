<p>Description:</p>

<pre>Scaffolds an entire resource, from model and migration to controller and
views, along with a full test suite. The resource is ready to use as a
starting point for your RESTful, resource-oriented application.

Pass the name of the model (in singular form), either CamelCased or
under_scored, as the first argument, and an optional list of attribute
pairs.

Attributes are field arguments specifying the model's attributes. You can
optionally pass the type and an index to each field. For instance:
&quot;title body:text tracking_id:integer:uniq&quot; will generate a title field of
string type, a body with text type and a tracking_id as an integer with an
unique index. &quot;index&quot; could also be given instead of &quot;uniq&quot; if one desires
a non unique index.

Timestamps are added by default, so you don't have to specify them by hand
as 'created_at:datetime updated_at:datetime'.

You don't have to think up every attribute up front, but it helps to
sketch out a few so you can start working with the resource immediately.

For example, 'scaffold post title body:text published:boolean' gives
you a model with those three attributes, a controller that handles
the create/show/update/destroy, forms to create and edit your posts, and
an index that lists them all, as well as a resources :posts declaration
in config/routes.rb.

If you want to remove all the generated files, run
'rails destroy scaffold ModelName'.</pre>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre>`rails generate scaffold post`
`rails generate scaffold post title body:text published:boolean`
`rails generate scaffold purchase amount:decimal tracking_id:integer:uniq`</pre>
