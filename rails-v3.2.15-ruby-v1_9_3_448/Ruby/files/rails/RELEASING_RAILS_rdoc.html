<h1 id="label-Releasing+Rails">Releasing <a href="../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a></h1>

<p>In this document, we’ll cover the steps necessary to release <a
href="../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>.  Each section contains steps to
take during that time before the release.  The times suggested in each
header are just that: suggestions.  However, they should really be
considered as minimums.</p>

<h2 id="label-10+Days+before+release">10 Days before release</h2>

<p>Today is mostly coordination tasks.  Here are the things you must do today:</p>

<h3 id="label-Is+the+CI+green%3F++If+not%2C+make+it+green.+%28See+%22Fixing+the+CI%22%29">Is the CI green?  If not, make it green. (See “Fixing the CI”)</h3>

<p>Do not release with a Red CI.  You can find the CI status here:</p>

<pre>http://travis-ci.org/#!/rails/rails</pre>

<h3 id="label-Is+Sam+Ruby+happy%3F++If+not%2C+make+him+happy.">Is Sam Ruby happy?  If not, make him happy.</h3>

<p>Sam Ruby keeps a test suite that makes sure the code samples in his book
(Agile Web Development with <a href="../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>)
all work.  These are valuable integration tests for <a
href="../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>.  You can check the status of his
tests here:</p>

<pre>http://intertwingly.net/projects/dashboard.html</pre>

<p>Do not release with Red AWDwR tests.</p>

<h3 id="label-Are+the+postgres+tests+green%3F+If+not%2C+make+them+green">Are the postgres tests green? If not, make them green</h3>

<p>Currently Travis CI doesn’t run the Active Record postgres tests. They are
working to resolve this, but in the mean time, it is crucial to ensure that
the tests are still green before release.</p>

<h3 id="label-Do+we+have+any+git+dependencies%3F++If+so%2C+contact+those+authors.">Do we have any git dependencies?  If so, contact those authors.</h3>

<p>Having git dependencies indicates that we depend on unreleased code.
Obviously rails cannot be released when it depends on unreleased code.
Contact the authors of those particular gems and work out a release date
that suits them.</p>

<h3 id="label-Contact+the+security+team+%28either+Koz+or+tenderlove%29">Contact the security team (either Koz or tenderlove)</h3>

<p>Let them know of your plans to release.  There may be security issues to be
addressed, and that can impact your release date.</p>

<h3 id="label-Notify+implementors.">Notify implementors.</h3>

<p>Ruby implementors have high stakes in making sure <a
href="../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> works.  Be kind and give them a
heads up that <a href="../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> will be released
soonish.</p>

<p>Send an email just giving a heads up about the upcoming release to these
lists:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>team@jruby.org</p>
</li><li>
<p>community@rubini.us</p>
</li><li>
<p>rubyonrails-core@googlegroups.com</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Implementors will love you and help you.</p>

<h2 id="label-3+Days+before+release">3 Days before release</h2>

<p>This is when you should release the release candidate.  Here are your tasks
for today:</p>

<h3 id="label-Is+the+CI+green%3F++If+not%2C+make+it+green.">Is the CI green?  If not, make it green.</h3>

<h3 id="label-Is+Sam+Ruby+happy%3F++If+not%2C+make+him+happy.">Is Sam Ruby happy?  If not, make him happy.</h3>

<h3 id="label-Are+the+postgres+tests+green%3F+If+not%2C+make+them+green">Are the postgres tests green? If not, make them green</h3>

<h3 id="label-Contact+the+security+team.++CVE+emails+must+be+sent+on+this+day.">Contact the security team.  CVE emails must be sent on this day.</h3>

<h3 id="label-Create+a+release+branch.">Create a release branch.</h3>

<p>From the stable branch, create a release branch.  For example, if you’re
releasing <a href="../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> 3.0.10, do this:</p>

<pre>[aaron@higgins rails (3-0-stable)]$ git checkout -b 3-0-10
Switched to a new branch '3-0-10'
[aaron@higgins rails (3-0-10)]$</pre>

<h3 id="label-Update+each+CHANGELOG.">Update each CHANGELOG.</h3>

<p>Many times commits are made without the CHANGELOG being updated.  You
should review the commits since the last release, and fill in any missing
information for each CHANGELOG.</p>

<p>You can review the commits for the 3.0.10 release like this:</p>

<pre>[aaron@higgins rails (3-0-10)]$ git log v3.0.9..</pre>

<p>If you’re doing a stable branch release, you should also ensure that all of
the CHANGELOG entries in the stable branch are also synced to the master
branch.</p>

<h3 id="label-Update+the+RAILS_VERSION+file+to+include+the+RC.">Update the <a href="RAILS_VERSION.html">RAILS_VERSION</a> file to include the RC.</h3>

<h3 id="label-Build+and+test+the+gem."><a href="../../classes/Build.html">Build</a> and test the gem.</h3>

<p>Run `rake install` to generate the gems and install them locally. Then try
generating a new app and ensure that nothing explodes.</p>

<p>This will stop you from looking silly when you push an RC to rubygems.org
and then realise it is broken.</p>

<h3 id="label-Release+the+gem.">Release the gem.</h3>

<p>IMPORTANT: Due to YAML parse problems on the rubygems.org server, it is
safest to use Ruby 1.8 when releasing.</p>

<p>Run `rake release`.  This will populate the gemspecs with data from <a
href="RAILS_VERSION.html">RAILS_VERSION</a>, commit the changes, tag it,
and push the gems to rubygems.org. Here are the commands that `rake
release` should use, so you can understand what to do in case anything goes
wrong:</p>

<pre>$ rake all:build
$ git commit -am'updating RAILS_VERSION'
$ git tag -m'tagging rc release' v3.0.10.rc1
$ git push
$ git push --tags
$ for i in $(ls dist); do gem push $i; done</pre>

<h3 id="label-Send+Rails+release+announcements">Send <a href="../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> release announcements</h3>

<p>Write a release announcement that includes the version, changes, and links
to github where people can find the specific commit list.  Here are the
mailing lists where you should announce:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>rubyonrails-core@googlegroups.com</p>
</li><li>
<p>rubyonrails-talk@googlegroups.com</p>
</li><li>
<p>ruby-talk@ruby-lang.org</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Use markdown format for your announcement.  Remember to ask people to
report issues with the release candidate to the rails-core mailing list.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: If any users experience regressions when using the release
candidate, you <strong>must</strong> postpone the release.  Bugfix releases
*should not* break existing applications.</p>

<h3 id="label-Post+the+announcement+to+the+Rails+blog."><a href="../../classes/Post.html">Post</a> the announcement to the <a href="../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> blog.</h3>

<p>If you used markdown format for your email, you can just paste it in to the
blog.</p>
<ul><li>
<p><a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org">weblog.rubyonrails.org</a></p>
</li></ul>

<h3 id="label-Post+the+announcement+to+the+Rails+twitter+account."><a href="../../classes/Post.html">Post</a> the announcement to the <a href="../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> twitter account.</h3>

<h2 id="label-Time+between+release+candidate+and+actual+release"><a href="../../classes/Time.html">Time</a> between release candidate and actual release</h2>

<p>Check the rails-core mailing list and the github issue list for regressions
in the RC.</p>

<p>If any regressions are found, fix the regressions and repeat the release
candidate process.  We will not release the final until 72 hours after the
last release candidate has been pushed.  This means that if users find
regressions, the scheduled release date must be postponed.</p>

<p>When you fix the regressions, do not create a new branch.  Fix them on the
stable branch, then cherry pick the commit to your release branch.  No
other commits should be added to the release branch besides regression
fixing commits.</p>

<h2 id="label-Day+of+release">Day of release</h2>

<p>Many of these steps are the same as for the release candidate, so if you
need more explanation on a particular step, so the RC steps.</p>

<p>Today, do this stuff in this order:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Apply security patches to the release branch</p>
</li><li>
<p>Update CHANGELOG with security fixes.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Update <a href="RAILS_VERSION.html">RAILS_VERSION</a> to remove the rc</p>
</li><li>
<p><a href="../../classes/Build.html">Build</a> and test the gem</p>
</li><li>
<p>Release the gems</p>
</li><li>
<p>Email security lists</p>
</li><li>
<p>Email general announcement lists</p>
</li></ul>

<h3 id="label-Emailing+the+rails+security+announce+list">Emailing the rails security announce list</h3>

<p>Email the security announce list once for each vulnerability fixed.</p>

<p>You can do this, or ask the security team to do it.</p>

<p>Email the security reports to:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>rubyonrails-security@googlegroups.com</p>
</li><li>
<p>linux-distros@vs.openwall.org</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Be sure to note the security fixes in your announcement along with CVE
numbers and links to each patch.  Some people may not be able to upgrade
right away, so we need to give them the security fixes in patch form.</p>
<ul><li>
<p><a href="../../classes/Blog.html">Blog</a> announcements</p>
</li><li>
<p>Twitter announcements</p>
</li><li>
<p>Merge the release branch to the stable branch.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Drink beer (or other cocktail)</p>
</li></ul>

<h2 id="label-Misc">Misc</h2>

<h3 id="label-Fixing+the+CI">Fixing the CI</h3>

<p>There are two simple steps for fixing the CI:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Identify the problem</p>
</li><li>
<p>Fix it</p>
</li></ol>

<p>Repeat these steps until the CI is green.</p>

<h3 id="label-Manually+trigger+docs+generation">Manually trigger docs generation</h3>

<p>We have a post-receive hook in GitHub that calls the docs server on pushes.
It triggers generation and publication of edge docs, updates the contrib
app, and generates and publishes stable docs if a new stable tag is
detected.</p>

<p>The hook unfortunately is not invoked by tag pushing, so once the new
stable tag has been pushed to origin, please run</p>

<pre>rake publish_docs</pre>

<p>You should see something like this:</p>

<pre>Rails master hook tasks scheduled:

  * updates the local checkout
  * updates Rails Contributors
  * generates and publishes edge docs

If a new stable tag is detected it also

  * generates and publishes stable docs

This needs typically a few minutes.</pre>

<p>Note you do not need to specify the tag, the docs server figures it out.</p>

<p>Also, don’t worry if you call that multiple times or the hook is triggered
again by some immediate regular push, if the scripts are running new calls
are just queued (in a queue of size 1).</p>
