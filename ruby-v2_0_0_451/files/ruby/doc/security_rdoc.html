<h1 id="label-Ruby+Security">Ruby Security</h1>

<p>The Ruby programming language is large and complex and there are many
security pitfalls often encountered by newcomers and experienced Rubyists
alike.</p>

<p>This document aims to discuss many of these pitfalls and provide more
secure alternatives where applicable.</p>

<p>Please check the full list of publicly known CVEs and how to correctly
report a security vulnerability, at: <a
href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/security">www.ruby-lang.org/en/security</a>/
Japanese version is here: <a
href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/ja/security">www.ruby-lang.org/ja/security</a>/</p>

<p>Security vulnerabilities should be reported via an email to <a
href="mailto:security@ruby-lang.org">security@ruby-lang.org</a> (<a
href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/security.asc">the PGP public key</a>), which
is a private mailing list. Reported problems will be published after fixes.</p>

<h2 id="label-%24SAFE"><code>$SAFE</code></h2>

<p>Ruby provides a mechanism to restrict what operations can be performed by
Ruby code in the form of the <code>$SAFE</code> variable.</p>

<p>However, <code>$SAFE</code> does not provide a secure environment for
executing untrusted code even at its maximum level of <code>4</code>.
<code>$SAFE</code> is inherently flawed as a security mechanism, as it
relies on every unsafe operation performed by any C method to be guarded by
a <code>$SAFE</code> check. If this check is ever missed, the entire
security of the system is compromised. <code>$SAFE</code> also does not
offer any protection against denial of service attacks.</p>

<p>If you need to execute untrusted code, you should use an operating system
level sandboxing mechanism. On Linux, ptrace or LXC can be used to sandbox
potentially malicious code. Other similar mechanisms exist on every major
operating system.</p>

<h2 id="label-Marshal.load"><code>Marshal.load</code></h2>

<p>Ruby&#39;s <code>Marshal</code> module provides methods for serializing and
deserializing Ruby object trees to and from a binary data format.</p>

<p>Never use <code>Marshal.load</code> to deserialize untrusted or user
supplied data. Because <code>Marshal</code> can deserialize to almost any
Ruby object and has full control over instance variables, it is possible to
craft a malicious payload that executes code shortly after deserialization.</p>

<p>If you need to deserialize untrusted data, you should use <a
href="../../../classes/JSON.html">JSON</a> as it is only capable of
returning &#39;primitive&#39; types such as strings, arrays, hashes,
numbers and nil. If you need to deserialize other classes, you should
handle this manually. Never deserialize to a user specified class.</p>

<h2 id="label-YAML">YAML</h2>

<p>YAML is a popular human readable data serialization format used by many
Ruby programs for configuration and database persistance of Ruby object
trees.</p>

<p>Similar to <code>Marshal</code>, it is able to deserialize into arbitrary
Ruby classes. For example, the following YAML data will create an
<code>ERB</code> object when deserialized:</p>

<pre><code>!ruby/object:ERB
src: puts `uname`</code></pre>

<p>Because of this, many of the security considerations applying to <a
href="../../../classes/Marshal.html">Marshal</a> are also applicable to
YAML. Do not use YAML to deserialize untrusted data.</p>

<h2 id="label-Symbols">Symbols</h2>

<p>Symbols are often seen as syntax sugar for simple strings, but they play a
much more crucial role. The MRI Ruby implementation uses Symbols internally
for method, variable and constant names. The reason for this is that
symbols are simply integers with names attached to them, so they are faster
to look up in hashtables.</p>

<p>Once a symbol is created, the memory used by it is never freed. If you
convert user input to symbols with <code>to_sym</code> or
<code>intern</code>, it is possible for an attacker to mount a denial of
service attack against your application by flooding it with unique strings.
Because each string is kept in memory until the Ruby process exits, this
will cause memory consumption to grow and grow until Ruby runs out of
memory and crashes.</p>

<p>Be careful with passing user input to methods such as <code>send</code>,
<code>instance_variable_get</code> or <code>_set</code>,
<code>const_get</code> or <code>_set</code>, etc. as these methods will
convert string parameters to symbols internally and pose the same DoS
potential as direct conversion through
<code>to_sym</code>/<code>intern</code>.</p>

<p>The workaround to this is simple - don&#39;t convert user input to symbols.
You should attempt to leave user input in string form instead.</p>

<h2 id="label-Regular+expressions">Regular expressions</h2>

<p>Ruby&#39;s regular expression syntax has some minor differences when
compared to other languages. In Ruby, the <code>^</code> and <code>$</code>
anchors do not refer to the beginning and end of the string, rather the
beginning and end of a <strong>line</strong>.</p>

<p>This means that if you&#39;re using a regular expression like
<code>/^[a-z]+$/</code> to restrict a string to only letters, an attacker
can bypass this check by passing a string containing a letter, then a
newline, then any string of their choosing.</p>

<p>If you want to match the beginning and end of the entire string in Ruby,
use the anchors <code>\A</code> and <code>\z</code>.</p>

<h2 id="label-eval"><code>eval</code></h2>

<p>Never pass untrusted or user controlled input to <code>eval</code>.</p>

<p>Unless you are implementing a REPL like <code>irb</code> or
<code>pry</code>, <code>eval</code> is almost certainly not what you want.
Do not attempt to filter user input before passing it to <code>eval</code>
- this approach is fraught with danger and will most likely open your
application up to a serious remote code execution vulnerability.</p>

<h2 id="label-send"><code>send</code></h2>

<p>&#39;Global functions&#39; in Ruby (<code>puts</code>, <code>exit</code>,
etc.) are actually private instance methods on <code>Object</code>. This
means it is possible to invoke these methods with <code>send</code>, even
if the call to <code>send</code> has an explicit receiver.</p>

<p>For example, the following code snippet writes “Hello world” to the
terminal:</p>

<pre><code>1.send(:puts, &quot;Hello world&quot;)</code></pre>

<p>You should never call <code>send</code> with user supplied input as the
first parameter. Doing so can introduce a denial of service vulnerability:</p>

<pre><code>foo.send(params[:bar]) # params[:bar] is &quot;exit!&quot;</code></pre>

<p>If an attacker can control the first two arguments to <code>send</code>,
remote code execution is possible:</p>

<pre><code># params is { :a =&gt; &quot;eval&quot;, :b =&gt; &quot;...ruby code to be executed...&quot; }
foo.send(params[:a], params[:b])
</code></pre>

<p>When dispatching a method call based on user input, carefully verify that
the method name. If possible, check it against a whitelist of safe method
names.</p>

<p>Note that the use of <code>public_send</code> is also dangerous, as
<code>send</code> itself is public:</p>

<pre><code>1.public_send(&quot;send&quot;, &quot;eval&quot;, &quot;...ruby code to be executed...&quot;)</code></pre>

<h2 id="label-DRb"><a href="../../../classes/DRb.html">DRb</a></h2>

<p>As <a href="../../../classes/DRb.html">DRb</a> allows remote clients to
invoke arbitrary methods, it is not suitable to expose to untrusted
clients.</p>

<p>When using <a href="../../../classes/DRb.html">DRb</a>, try to avoid
exposing it over the network if possible. If this isn&#39;t possible and
you need to expose <a href="../../../classes/DRb.html">DRb</a> to the
world, you <strong>must</strong> configure an appropriate security policy
with <code>DRb::ACL</code>.</p>
